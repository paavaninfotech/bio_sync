# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 20, 2025

Bio Sync is an ERPNext extension for syncing biometric attendance data. This policy outlines how the app handles user and employee data.

## 1. Data Collected

- Biometric ID (Employee Identifier)
- Timestamped check-in/check-out data
- Device ID (if mapped)
- Database connection settings (stored securely)

## 2. Data Storage

Bio Sync does **not** transmit data outside your ERPNext server. All data is stored within your ERPNext database under your control.

## 3. Access and Control

- Only authorized users with permissions in ERPNext can access or trigger syncs.
- You may delete synced records at any time using ERPNext UI.

## 4. Security

- Passwords for database connections are stored encrypted.
- App uses Frappeâ€™s ORM and permission framework for access control.

## 5. Third-Party Systems

As Bio Sync connects to external biometric systems, ensure those systems comply with your local data protection laws.
